# Tuwaiq_T5_BootCamp_Project

This project is about building a Customer Behavior Prediction Model Using RFM and Logistic Regression.

In This project, I will be using Python to try and build a model that can predict when the next date a customer will buy from the store. The data used in this project is an E-Commerce dataset from Kaggle, which contains actual transactions from UK retailers.


**This project consists of 4 stages:**<br />
Stage 1: Data cleaning and data preprocessing using Pandas, Numpy. <br />
Stage 2: Conducting EDA on the data using Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly. <br />
Stage 3: Building the model using Scikit-learn, Logistic Regression model, RFM Model for customer segmentation, K-Means Clustering.</br>
Stage 4: Present the results.
